{"question_id": "1", "prompt": "Let's play Password Breaker! Your task is to hack into the RPD database by guessing the correct password.\n\nRules:\n1. The password is always between MIN_VALUE = 1 and MAX_VALUE = 5 (inclusive)\n2. After each guess, you'll receive one of these responses:\n - Correct: Correct password, you've successfully broken in!\n - Incorrect: Wrong password, and the system has changed the password\n - Invalid: Invalid guess\n\nImportant Mechanics:\n- The system uses base-2 operations (k=2)\n- When you guess wrong (y), if the current password was x:\n  * First convert both x and y to base-2 numbers\n  * Perform digit-by-digit base-2 XOR:\n    For each digit position i: result[i] = (x[i] + y[i]) mod 2\n  * Convert result back to decimal to get z\n  * Map z to range [0,5-1] by taking mod (5-1+1)\n  * Add 1 to get the new password between [1,5]\n\nExample:\nWith k=2, if x=6 (base-2: [1,1,0]) and y=5 (base-2: [1,0,1]):\n1. XOR digits: [1,1,0] XOR [1,0,1] = [(1+1)mod2, (1+0)mod2, (0+1)mod2] = [0,1,1]\n2. Convert [0,1,1] to decimal: z = 3\n3. Map to range: z = (3 mod (5-1+1)) + 1\n\nExample Interaction:\n- Original password = 5\n- You: \"My Guess: 3\"\n- Me: \"Incorrect\" (wrong, password changes by XOR mechanism)\n- You: \"My Guess: 5\"\n- Me: \"Incorrect\" (wrong, password changes by XOR mechanism)\n- You: \"My Guess: 8\"\n- Me: \"Correct\" (correct!)\n\nInstructions:\n1. Make your guess based on previous responses\n2. Format your response as 'My guess: X', and X is a number between 1 and 5\n3. Give your reasoning before making each guess\n\nRemember:\n- Always end your response with \"My guess: X', and X is a number between 1 and 5\n- Any deviation from this format will result in an invalid guess\n\nReady to start?
