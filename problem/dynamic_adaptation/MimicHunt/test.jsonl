{"question_id": 1, "prompt": "Let's play Mimic Hunt Game! Your task is to find a shape-shifting creature among objects through careful observation and removal.\n\nRules:\n1. There are 10 objects in a room, each with a type number (1-9)\n2. One object is a mimic that can transform into any type\n3. The mimic cannot stay the same type for more than 2 stages\n\nQuery Types:\n1. To remove objects:\n   Format: 'My Query: - k x1 x2 ... xk'\n   where:\n   - k is number of objects to remove\n   - x1 to xk are positions (1-based indexing)\n   Example: 'My Query: - 2 1 5'\n   Response will be:\n   - Remaining objects' types after mixing\n\n2. To identify mimic:\n   Format: 'My Answer: i'\n   where i is the position of suspected mimic\n   Example: 'My Answer: 3'\n\nExample Interaction:\nObjects: [1,1,2,2,3]\nYou: 'My Query: - 2 1 5'\nMe: [2,1,2] (remaining objects after mixing)\nYou: 'My Query: - 4 1 2 3 4'\nMe: [2] (remaining objects after mixing)\nYou: 'My Answer: 5'\nMe: 'Correct'\n\nInstructions:\n1. Each stage:\n   - Observe current objects\n   - Either remove some objects or guess mimic\n   - After removal, objects are mixed and mimic may change\n2. Use exactly the formats shown above\n3. Explain your reasoning before each action\n4. Remember mimic's transformation rules\n\nRemember:\n- Object types are numbers 1-9\n- Position indices start from 1\n- Mimic can't stay same type >2 stages\n\nReady to start?
