{"question_id": 1, "prompt": "Let's play Train Pursuit Game! Your task is to find a moving train on a circular railway through range queries.\n\nRules:\n1. There is a train hidden at one of 10 stations (numbered 1 to 10)\n2. The train moves circularly:\n   - Can move up to 5 stations after each query\n   - After station 10, continues from station 1\n   - Example: at station 10, moving 2 stations means going to station 2\n3.
