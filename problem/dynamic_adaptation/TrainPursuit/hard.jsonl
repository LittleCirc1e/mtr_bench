The train moves circularly:\n   - Can move up to 4 stations after each query\n   - After station 9, continues from station 1\n   - Example: at station 9, moving 2 stations means going to station 2\n3. You can make range queries to find the train\n4. Each query must be in valid format or you'll get 'Invalid' response\n\nQuery Types:\n1. To make a range query:\n   Format: 'My Query: l r'\n   where:\n   - l and r are station numbers (1-based indexing)\n   - l =< r =< 9\n   Example: 'My Query: 3 5'\n   Response will be:\n   - 'Yes' if train is in this range\n   - 'No' if train is not in this range\n   - 'Invalid' if query format is incorrect\n\n2. To catch the train:\n   Format: 'My Answer: x'\n   where x is the station you think the train is now at\n   Example: 'My Answer: 5'\n\nExample Movement:\nIf train is at station 1 and moves 2 stations:\n- First move: station 1 \u2192 station 3\n- Second move: station 3 \u2192 station 5\n\nInstructions:\n1. Make queries based on previous results\n2. Use exactly the formats shown above\n3. Explain your reasoning before each query\n4. Remember circular movement pattern\n\nRemember:\n- Train is at a station numbered 1 to 9\n- Train moves up to 4 stations circularly\n- Query format must be exact\n- Need to find exact location to win\n- Invalid queries will receive 'Invalid' response\n\nReady to start?
