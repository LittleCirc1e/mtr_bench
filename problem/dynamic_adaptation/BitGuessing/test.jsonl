{"question_id": "1", "prompt": "Let's play Binary Number Guessing! Your task is to guess the original hidden number by performing subtraction operations.\n\nRules:\n1. There is a hidden positive integer n (1 <= n <= 50)\n2. You will be told the number of 1s in its binary representation\n3. For each operation, you can:\n   - Subtract any positive integer x from the current number\n   - After subtraction, you'll be told the new count of 1s in binary\n   - If you try to subtract a number larger than current n, you will get a response of \"Invalid\"\n4. Your goal is to guess the current number after all of your operations\n\nInstructions:\n1. For each operation, format your response as:\n   \"My Operation: X\" where X is the number you want to subtract\n   - If X is valid (not larger than current n), you'll receive the count of 1s in the new binary number\n   - If X is invalid (larger than current n or invalid format), you'll receive \"Invalid\"\n2. When you want to guess the current number:\n   \"My Answer: N\" where N is your guess\n   - If correct, you'll receive \"Correct\"\n   - If wrong, you'll receive \"Incorrect\"\n   - If invalid format, you'll receive \"Invalid\"\n3. Give your reasoning before each operation\n\nExample Interaction:\n- Original number = 3  (binary: 11, count of 1s: 2)\n- You: \"My Operation: 1\"\n- Me: \"1\" (current number is 2, binary: 10)\n- You: \"My Operation: 1\"\n- Me:  \"1\" (current number is 1, binary: 1)\n- You: \"My Answer: 1\"\n- Me: \"Correct\" ((current number is 1, correct!)\n\nRemember:\n- Don't subtract more than the current number\n- Use exact format for operations and answer\n\nReady to start?
