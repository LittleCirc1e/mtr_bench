To make a range query:\n   Format: 'My Query: l r'\n   where:\n   - l and r are the range boundaries (1 =< l =< r =< 17)\n   Example: 'My Query: 1 4'\n   Response will be number of students who raised hands\n\n2. To mark absent students:\n   Format: 'My Answer: a'\n   where:\n   - a is the student number you think is absent\n   Example: 'My Answer: 3'\n\nResponse Types for Range Queries:\nFor a query (l,r), you'll get either r-l or r-l+1 students raising hands:\n1.
