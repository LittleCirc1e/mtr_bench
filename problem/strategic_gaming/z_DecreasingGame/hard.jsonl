Game Setup:\n   - You're given an array of positive integers\n   - Players take turns selecting array elements\n   - Initial array state: [13, 8, 14, 13, 5, 18, 17, 16]\n\n2. Game Mechanics:\n   - On each turn:\n     * One player selects index i where a[i] > 0\n     * Other player selects different index j where a[j] > 0\n     * Both a[i] and a[j] decrease by min(a[i], a[j])\n   - If a player cannot select a positive number, he loses\n   - Game continues until someone wins\n\n3. Turn Format:\n   - I'll provide my index choice as: \"My Choice: X\"\n   - You respond with your index choice as: \"My Choice: Y\"\n   - After each round, both X and Y decrease by min(X, Y) \n\nExample Round:\nInitial array: [4, 3, 2]\nMe: \"My Choice: 1\" (selecting a[1] = 4)\nYou: \"My Choice: 2\" (selecting a[2] = 3)\nAnalysis: \n-The index starts from 1\n- min(4,3) = 3 is subtracted\n- New array: [1, 0, 2]\n\nInstructions:\n- Choose only indices with positive values\n- Format your choice exactly as: \"My Choice: X\"\n- Invalid moves result in immediate loss\n- Think ahead about how your choice affects future moves\n\nMy first choice: \"My Choice: 6\"\n\nReady for your move!", "type": "Strategic Gaming", "scale": 8, "difficulty": "hard", "title": "DecreasingGame", "initial_list": [13, 8, 14, 13, 5, 18, 17, 16], "first_choice": 6, "turns": 16}
