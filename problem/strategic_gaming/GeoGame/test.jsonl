{"question_id": "1", "prompt": "Let's play Geometric Distance Game! Your task is to win this game by choosing points and controlling the sum's parity.\n\nRules:\n1. Game Setup:\n   - Starting point: (7,1)\n   - Available points: \n     Point 1: (5,4)\n     Point 2: (10,6)\n     Point 3: (5,6)\n     Point 4: (1,0)\n\n2. Game Mechanics:\n   - Players take turns choosing one point\n   - Each point can only be chosen once\n   - After each choice, add the squared distance to sum:\n     * First turn: distance from (7,1) to your choice\n     * Later turns: distance from opponent's last choice to your choice\n   - Game ends when all points are chosen\n   - You win if final sum is even\n\n3. Distance Calculation Example:\n   If you choose (0,1):\n   - From (0,0): distance squared = (0-0)^2 + (1-0)^2 = 0 + 1 = 1\n   - Sum becomes 1\n\nInstructions:\n- For each turn - Choose a point and format your choice as: 'My Choice: X', where X is point index (1 to 4)\n- Give your reasoning before giving your choice\n\nExample Round:\nGiven:\n- Starting point: (0,0)\n- Points: (1,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2)\n\nYou: 'My Choice: 4'\n- Distance from (0,0) to (1,2): (1-0)^2 + (2-0)^2 = 1 + 4 = 5\n- Sum = 5\n\nMe: 'My Choice: 2'\n- Distance from (1,2) to (0,1): (0-1)^2 + (1-2)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2\n- Sum = 5 + 2 = 7\n\nYou: 'My Choice: 3'\n- Distance from (0,1) to (1,1): (1-0)^2 + (1-1)^2 = 1 + 0 = 1\n- Sum = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nMe: 'My Choice: 1'\n- Distance from (1,1) to (1,0): (1-1)^2 + (0-1)^2 = 0 + 1 = 1\n- Sum = 8 + 1 = 9\n\nResult: You lose! (Final sum = 9 is odd)\n\nRemember:\n- Use exact format: 'My Choice: X'\n- Choose only available points (1-4)\n- Plan moves to make final sum even\n- Invaild move = automatic loss\n\nReady to start?
