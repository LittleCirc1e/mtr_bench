Game Setup:\n   - I have a 10*10 grid\n   - Initially colored cells:\n- Cell at position (4, 1) is colored with color 13\n- Cell at position (6, 5) is colored with color 13\n- Cell at position (5, 5) is colored with color 13\n- Cell at position (3, 8) is colored with color 13\n- Cell at position (3, 2) is colored with color 13\n- Cell at position (8, 8) is colored with color 13\n- Cell at position (8, 9) is colored with color 13\n- Cell at position (9, 6) is colored with color 13\n- Cell at position (9, 8) is colored with color 13\n- Cell at position (3, 10) is colored with color 13\n- Cell at position (8, 7) is colored with color 13\n\n\n2. Game Mechanics:\n   - You can make up to 10 moves\n   - Each move: Choose an uncolored cell by specifying coordinates (x,y)\n   - I will respond by coloring that cell with a color of my choice (1 to 20)\n   - Your goal: Find 4 colored cells that form a valid rectangle\n\n3. Victory Conditions:\n   A valid rectangle must:\n   - Have all 4 cells colored\n   - Have different colors in all 4 cells\n   - Form a rectangle with sides parallel to grid lines\n   \nInstructions:\n- For each move, format your query as: \"My Choice: x y\" (where 1=<x,y=<10)\n- When you find a valid rectangle, submit your answer as: \"My Answer: x1 x2 y1 y2\"\n   where (x1,y1), (x1,y2), (x2,y1), (x2,y2) are the coordinates of your rectangle\n- Give your reasoning before making each move\n- Wait for my response (color number) before making your next move\n\nExample Interaction:\nGiven a 3*3 grid with initial coloring:\n- Cell at position (1,1) has color 1\n- Cell at position (2,2) has color 2\n- Cell at position (3,3) has color 3\n\nYou: 'My Choice: 1 2'\n\nI: 'Cell (1,2) colored with color 4'\n\nYou: 'My Choice: 2 1'\n\nI: 'Cell (2,1) colored with color 5'\n\nYou: 'My Answer: 1 2 1 2'\n\nI: 'Win!'\n\nRemember:\n- Use exact format: \"My Choice: x y\" for queries\n- Use exact format: \"My Answer: x1 x2 y1 y2\" for final answer\n- Explain your reasoning before making a choice\n- Wait for my color response before next move\n- Choosing already colored cell = invalid move = immediate loss\n- All 4 cells in rectangle must have different colors\n\nReady to start?
