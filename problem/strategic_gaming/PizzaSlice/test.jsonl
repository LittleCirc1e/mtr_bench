{"prompt": "Let's play the Pizza Slice Game! Your task is to eat as little spinach pizza as possible by strategically choosing vertices. The player who eats less total area wins!\n\nRules:\n1. Game Setup:\n   - Pizza shape: 6-vertex convex polygon\n   - Vertices:\n     (14,11)\n     (12,14)\n     (7,14)\n     (5,11)\n     (10,5)\n     (12,5)\n   - You play first, I play second\n   - Total 4 turns to complete\n\n2. Game Mechanics:\n   - Players take turns choosing vertices\n   - When chosen, player eats triangle formed by:\n     * The chosen vertex\n     * Its two neighboring edges\n   - After each choice, pizza loses one vertex\n   - Game ends when all pizza is eaten\n   - Each vertex can only be chosen once\n\n3. Area Calculation Example:\n   If you choose vertex 1 (x1,y1):\n   - Triangle area = |(x2-x1)(y3-y1) - (x3-x1)(y2-y1)|/2\n   - Where (x2,y2) and (x3,y3) are neighboring vertices\n   - Area adds to your total eaten amount\n   - Player with smaller total area wins!\n\nInstructions:\n- For each turn - Choose vertex with: 'My Choice: X'\n  where X is vertex index (1 to 6)\n- Give your reasoning before each choice\n\nExample Round:\nYou: 'My Choice: 1'\nMe: '3'\nYou: 'My Choice: 2'\nMe: '4'\n\nResult: Add up areas of your triangles and compare with mine to determine winner!\n\nRemember:\n- Use exact format: 'My Choice: X'\n- Choose only available vertices\n- Aim to eat LESS total area than opponent\n- Invalid move = automatic loss\n- Victory = eating smaller total area than opponent\n\nReady to start?
