{"prompt": "Let's play the Zigzag Graph Game! Your task is to win this game by strategically moving through the graph while following increasing or decreasing edge weights.\n\nRules:\n1. Game Setup:\n   - Graph: 8*8 bipartite graph\n   - Left nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\n   - Right nodes: 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16\n   - Edge weights:\n          Node 1: [26, 10, 40, 58, 33, 4, 41, 19] to nodes 9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16\n     Node 2: [12, 34, 60, 16, 7, 9, 38, 56] to nodes 9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16\n     Node 3: [30, 11, 62, 59, 55, 27, 51, 1] to nodes 9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16\n     Node 4: [24, 14, 15, 21, 37, 48, 6, 46] to nodes 9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16\n     Node 5: [25, 13, 36, 32, 61, 47, 43, 53] to nodes 9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16\n     Node 6: [44, 3, 45, 52, 42, 17, 57, 8] to nodes 9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16\n     Node 7: [35, 5, 31, 28, 22, 20, 29, 64] to nodes 9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16\n     Node 8: [39, 50, 63, 54, 18, 49, 2, 23] to nodes 9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16\n   - All edge weights are distinct\n\n2. Game Mechanics:\n   - You choose \"decreasing\" mode and I choose \"increasing\" mode\n   - You place token on one node and then I place token on one node\n   - Players take turns moving token to adjacent unvisited nodes:\n     * Must move from opponent's last chosen node\n     * Edge weight must be less than last used edge (for you)\n     * Edge weight must be greater than last used edge (for me)\n   - Cannot visit same node twice\n\n3. Victory Conditions:\n   - Player loses if unable to make a valid move from opponent's node\n   - Game ends when no legal moves remain\n\nInstructions:\n- Format your move as: 'My Choice: X' where X is the node number (1-16)\n- Give your reasoning before each move\n- Wait for my response before your next move\n\nExample Round:\nInitial placement:\nYou: 'My Choice: 2'\n- Placing token at node 2\n\nI: 'My Choice: 5'\n- Moving from node 2 to node 5 with edge weight 8\n\nYou: 'My Choice: 3'\n- Moving from node 5 to node 3 with edge weight 6\n- Following decreasing rule: 6 < 8\n\nI: 'My Choice: 6'\n- Moving from node 3 to node 6 with edge weight 9\n- Following increasing rule: 9 > 6\n\nRemember:\n- Use exact format: 'My Choice: X'\n- Must move from opponent's last node\n- Follow decreasing weight rule\n- Invalid move = automatic loss\n\nReady to start?
