{"prompt": "Let's play the Zigzag Graph Game! Your task is to win this game by strategically moving through the graph while following increasing or decreasing edge weights.\n\nRules:\n1. Game Setup:\n   - Graph: 5*5 bipartite graph\n   - Left nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n   - Right nodes: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\n   - Edge weights:\n          Node 1: [15, 8, 9, 13, 10] to nodes 6,7,8,9,10\n     Node 2: [7, 2, 24, 4, 17] to nodes 6,7,8,9,10\n     Node 3: [19, 3, 25, 20, 16] to nodes 6,7,8,9,10\n     Node 4: [21, 1, 6, 5, 12] to nodes 6,7,8,9,10\n     Node 5: [11, 14, 23, 22, 18] to nodes 6,7,8,9,10\n   - All edge weights are distinct\n\n2. Game Mechanics:\n   - You choose \"decreasing\" mode and I choose \"increasing\" mode\n   - You place token on one node and then I place token on one node\n   - Players take turns moving token to adjacent unvisited nodes:\n     * Must move from opponent's last chosen node\n     * Edge weight must be less than last used edge (for you)\n     * Edge weight must be greater than last used edge (for me)\n   - Cannot visit same node twice\n\n3. Victory Conditions:\n   - Player loses if unable to make a valid move from opponent's node\n   - Game ends when no legal moves remain\n\nInstructions:\n- Format your move as: 'My Choice: X' where X is the node number (1-10)\n- Give your reasoning before each move\n- Wait for my response before your next move\n\nExample Round:\nInitial placement:\nYou: 'My Choice: 2'\n- Placing token at node 2\n\nI: 'My Choice: 5'\n- Moving from node 2 to node 5 with edge weight 8\n\nYou: 'My Choice: 3'\n- Moving from node 5 to node 3 with edge weight 6\n- Following decreasing rule: 6 < 8\n\nI: 'My Choice: 6'\n- Moving from node 3 to node 6 with edge weight 9\n- Following increasing rule: 9 > 6\n\nRemember:\n- Use exact format: 'My Choice: X'\n- Must move from opponent's last node\n- Follow decreasing weight rule\n- Invalid move = automatic loss\n\nReady to start?
