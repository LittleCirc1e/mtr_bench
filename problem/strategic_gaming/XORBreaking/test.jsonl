{"prompt": "Let's play the XOR Break Game! Your task is to win this game by strategically breaking numbers and forcing your opponent into a position where they can't make a valid move.\n\nRules:\n1. Game Setup:\n   - Initial number: 83812\n   - You play first\n   - I play second\n   - Maximum 20 moves allowed\n\n2. Game Mechanics:\n   First Turn:\n   - You break initial number p into two numbers p1 and p2\n   - Must satisfy: 0 < p1,p2 < p and p1\u2295p2 = p\n\n   Subsequent Turns:\n   - Active player does two actions:\n     1. Choose one number (p1 or p2) from opponent's break\n     2. Try to break chosen number into two new numbers\n   - If player cannot break their chosen number, they lose\n   - Game continues until someone can't break their number\n\n3. XOR Calculation Example:\n   Breaking 13:\n   - Can choose 10 and 7 because:\n     * 10 = 1010 in binary\n     * 7 = 0111 in binary\n     * 10\u22957 = 1101 = 13\n   - Both numbers are less than 13\n   - Both numbers are positive\n\nInstructions:\nFirst Turn Format:\n- Your move: 'Breaking into: p1 p2'\n- Example: 'Breaking into: 10 7'\n\nOther Turns Format:\n- Your move: 'Choosing: p Breaking into: p1 p2'\n- My response: Either\n  * 'Choosing: x Breaking into: y z'\n  or\n  * 'Choosing: x Cannot break further'\n\nExample Round:\nInitial number: 13\n\nYou: 'Breaking into: 10 7'\n- Breaking 13 into 10\u22957\n- Both numbers less than 13\n\nMe: 'Choosing: 7 Breaking into: 3 4'\n- Selected 7 and broke it into 3\u22954\n\nYou: 'Choosing: 3 Breaking into: 2 1'\n- Selected 3 and broke it into 2\u22951\n\nMe: 'Choosing: 1 Cannot break further'\n- You win! 1 cannot be broken\n\nRemember:\n- Use exact format for moves\n- Numbers must satisfy:\n  * Less than current number\n  * Greater than 0\n  * XOR to current number\n- Invalid break = automatic loss\n- More than 20 moves = loss\n\nReady to start?
