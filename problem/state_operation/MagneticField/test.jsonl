{"question_id": 1, "prompt": "Let's play Magnetic Field Explorer! Your task is to navigate through a grid with mysterious magnetic forces.\n\nRules:\n1. Game Field:\n   - A 3 * 3 grid with:\n     * Numbers (1-4) - Different types of magnetic fields\n     * \".\" - Neutral space\n     * \"X\" - Danger zone (avoid these)\n     * \"G\" - Goal (reach here to win)\n   - Start: (1, 1) (top-left corner)\n   - Goal: (3, 3) (bottom-right corner)\n\n2. Magnetic Fields:\n   - Four types of magnetic fields (1-4)\n   - Each number represents a unique direction (North, South, East, or West)\n   - You'll discover the direction of each number through movement\n   - Same number always means same direction\n   - When you enter a magnetic field:\n     * You will be forced to move one step in its direction\n     * If that step would hit a boundary, you stay on the magnetic field\n     * If that step would hit a danger zone, you lose\n     * If that step would hit another magnetic field, you move there and it activates\n\n3. Movement Rules:\n   - Basic moves: U(up), D(down), L(left), R(right)\n   - Movement sequence for each turn:\n     1. You move one step in your chosen direction\n     2. If you land on:\n        - Magnetic field: Move one step in its direction unless that step would hit a boundary\n        - Danger zone: You lose\n        - Neutral space: Stay there\n     3. If magnetic field pushed you to another magnetic field, repeat step 2\n\nCurrent Grid Layout (with coordinates):\n  1 2 3  (column)\n1 . 1 4 \n2 . X 2 \n3 . . G \n(row)\n\nGrid positions:\n(1,1): Neutral space\n(1,2): Magnetic field type 1\n(1,3): Magnetic field type 4\n(2,1): Neutral space\n(2,2): Danger zone\n(2,3): Magnetic field type 2\n(3,1): Neutral space\n(3,2): Neutral space\n(3,3): Goal\n\n\nMove Format:\n1. To make a move:\n   Format: 'My Move: X'\n   where X is one of: U, D, L, R\n   Example: 'My Move: R'\n\n2. System Response:\n   Format: 'x y'\n   - Shows your final position coordinates\n   - (-1, -1) if you hit danger zone\n\nRemember:\n- Each number (1-4) represents a fixed direction\n- Figure out what direction each number represents\n- Magnetic fields activate when you land on them\n- Avoid danger zones (X)\n- Reach goal (G) to win\n- You don't necessarily need to figure out or pass through the magnetic fields; your goal is only to reach the target zone (3, 3) safely.\n\nReady to start?
