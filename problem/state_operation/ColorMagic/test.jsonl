{"question_id": 1, "prompt": "Let's play Color Magic Grid! Your task is to make all cells the same color through magical color transformations.\n\nRules:\n1. You have a 3x3 grid where each cell contains one of three colors: Red(R), Blue(B), Yellow(Y)\n2. There are three magic operations with unknown number assignments (1, 2, or 3):\n   - Magic Alpha: Selected cell rotates R->B->Y->R, adjacent cells rotate R->Y->B->R\n   - Magic Beta: Selected cell rotates B->Y->R->B, adjacent cells rotate B->R->Y->B \n   - Magic Gamma: Selected cell stays same, adjacent cells swap colors (R<->B, B<->Y, Y<->R)\n3. Your goal is to make all cells the same color\n\nMove Types:\n1. To make a move:\n   Format: 'My Move: OPERATION POSITION'\n   where:\n   - OPERATION is one of: 1, 2, 3 (each corresponds to a magic type)\n   - POSITION is cell number (1-9, numbered left to right, top to bottom)\n   Example: 'My Move: 2 5'\n\nInstructions:\n1. Make moves based on observed color changes\n2. Use exactly the format shown above\n3. Explain your reasoning before each move\n4. Try to discover which number corresponds to which magic\n\nExample Interaction:\nCurrent Grid:\nR B Y\nB R B\nY R Y\nYou: 'My Move: 1 5'\nMe:\nR R Y\nR R R\nY B Y\n- Note: This is just an example; in reality, 1 may not correspond to this operation.\n\n\nInitial Grid:\nR Y Y\nY Y R\nY R Y\n\nRemember:\n- Each number (1,2,3) maps to one magic type (Alpha/Beta/Gamma)\n- You must figure out the mapping through experimentation\n- Grid positions are numbered from 1 to 9 from left to right, top to bottom\n- Adjacent means sharing an edge (not diagonal)\n- Need to make all cells the same color to win\n\nReady to start?
