{"question_id": 30, "prompt": "Let's play DarkMazeExplorer! Your task is to find your way through a dark maze using only directional movements.\n\nRules:\n1. You are exploring a 4*4 maze\n2. Each cell may have walls in any direction (North, East, South, West)\n3. You start at position (1,1) and must reach (4,4)\n4. You can only make one directional move at a time\n5. You cannot move through walls or outside the maze boundaries\n\nMove Types:\n1. To make a move:\n   Format: 'My Choice: X'\n   where:\n   - X is one of: N, E, S, W (representing directions)\n   - N = North, E = East, S = South, W = West\n   Example: 'My Choice: E'\n\nAfter each move you will receive:\n- MOVED: successfully moved into the next cell in your chosen direction\n- BLOCKED: wall exists in that direction\n- INVALID: tried to move outside maze boundaries\n- WIN: reached the exit at (4,4)\n\nExample Interaction:\nStarting at (1,1) with North and West walls\nYou: 'My Choice: E'\nMe: 'MOVED'\nYou: 'My Choice: N'\nMe: 'BLOCKED'\nYou: 'My Choice: S'\nMe: 'WIN'\n\nInstructions:\n1.
