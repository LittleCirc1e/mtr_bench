{"question_id": 1, "prompt": "Let's play DarkMazeExplorer! Your task is to find your way through a dark maze using only directional movements.\n\nRules:\n1. You are exploring a 2*2 maze\n2. Each cell may have walls in any direction (North, East, South, West)\n3. You start at position (1,1) and must reach (2,2)\n4. You can only make one directional move at a time\n5. You cannot move through walls or outside the maze boundaries\n\nMove Types:\n1. To make a move:\n   Format: 'My Choice: X'\n   where:\n   - X is one of: N, E, S, W (representing directions)\n   - N = North, E = East, S = South, W = West\n   Example: 'My Choice: E'\n\nAfter each move you will receive:\n- MOVED: successfully moved into the next cell in your chosen direction\n- BLOCKED: wall exists in that direction\n- INVALID: tried to move outside maze boundaries\n- WIN: reached the exit at (2,2)\n\nExample Interaction:\nStarting at (1,1) with North and West walls\nYou: 'My Choice: E'\nMe: 'MOVED'\nYou: 'My Choice: N'\nMe: 'BLOCKED'\nYou: 'My Choice: S'\nMe: 'WIN'\n\nInstructions:\n1. Make moves based on feedback\n2. Use exactly the format shown above\n3. Explain your reasoning before each move\n4. Plan your path carefully\n\nRemember:\n- Starting room (1,1) has North and West walls\n- You can only see walls when you encounter them\n- Need to mentally map the maze\n- Cannot move through walls or outside boundaries\n- Must reach (2,2) to win\n\nReady to start?
