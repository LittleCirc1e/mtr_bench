{"question_id": 1, "prompt": "Let's play Chemical Synthesis! Your task is to create compound BAFC through different operations in an unstable environment.\n\nRules:\n1. Basic Setup:\n   - Initial compounds: B, AG, FD, CE\n   - Goal: Create BAFC\n   - Four types of operations (1,2,3,4)\n   - Element order matters (ABC \u2260 CBA)\n   - After each operation, resulting compounds and original compounds can be used\n\n2. Operation Types (numbers 1-4 each correspond to one of these):\n   SPLIT: \n   - Usually breaks a compound into two parts of its first element and the other elements\n   - Sometimes splits at a random position due to instability\n   - Example: ABC -> A + BC (normal) or AB + C (unstable)\n   - Format: 'My Move: X N' (X is a compound, and N=1/2/3/4)\n   \n   MERGE:\n   - Combines two compounds into one\n   - May cause a catalytic reaction that changes element order\n   - Result usually keeps elements in order, but might rearrange\n   - Example: AB + CD -> ABCD (normal) or ACBD (catalytic)\n   - Format: 'My Move: X Y N' (X,Y are two compounds, and N=1/2/3/4)\n   \n   SWAP:\n   - Exchanges elements within a compound\n   - High energy might cause multiple swaps\n   - Example: ABC -> CBA (normal) or BAC (partial)\n   - Format: 'My Move: X N'  (X is a compound, and N=1/2/3/4)\n   \n   EXTRACT:\n   - Takes out one element from a compound\n   - Usually the last element, but might extract a random element\n   - Example: ABC -> C (normal) or B (unstable)\n   - Format: 'My Move: X N' (X is a compound, and N=1/2/3/4)\n\n3. Operation Format and Responses:\n   Single Compound Operations (SPLIT, SWAP, EXTRACT):\n   - Format: 'My Move: X N'\n   Example: 'My Move: BC 1'\n\n   MERGE Operation:\n   - Format: 'My Move: X Y N'\n   Example: 'My Move: AB CD 2' \n\n   System Responses:\n   - Valid query: \"Available: [list of unrepeated available compounds]\"\n   - Invalid query: \"Wrong type\"/\"Invalid format\"/\"Invalid compound\"\n   - Success: \"WIN\"\n   \n4. Current State:\nAvailable Compounds: ['B', 'AG', 'FD', 'CE']\n\nImportant Notes:\n- Element order matters (ABC \u2260 CBA)\n- Operations are consistent but their numbers (1-4) are unknown\n- Chemical instability may cause unexpected results\n- Goal compound must match exactly (including element order)\n- Can only operate on currently available compounds\n- System will return \"Wrong type\" if:\n  * Using single-element compounds for SPLIT/SWAP/EXTRACT\n  * Using wrong number of compounds for operation\n\nExample Valid Interactions:\nInitial: 'ABC AB D'\nYou: 'My Move: ABC 1'\nMe: 'Available: ABC A BC AB D'      (normal split)\nYou: 'My Move: AB D 2'\nMe: 'Available: ABC A BC AB D DAB'   (unstable merge)\n\nExample Invalid Interactions:\nYou: 'My Move: A B 1'        (invalid: single element for SPLIT)\nMe: 'Wrong type'\nYou: 'My Move: AB 2'       (invalid: MERGE needs two compounds)\nMe: 'Wrong type'\n\nGoal: Create BAFC (exact order matters)\n\nReady to start!
