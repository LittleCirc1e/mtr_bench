{"question_id": 1, "prompt": "Let's play Finding the Biggest! Your task is to find and collect the highest value treasure through strategic movement on the grid.\n\nRules:\n1. You are an explorer on a 3*3 grid\n2. There are exactly 2 treasures hidden on the grid\n3. Each treasure has a value between 1 and 100\n4. You start at position (1,1)\n5. Movement rules:\n   - From position (x,y), you can move to any of its 8 adjacent cells:\n   - (x-1,y-1), (x-1,y), (x-1,y+1)\n   - (x,y-1),             (x,y+1)\n   - (x+1,y-1), (x+1,y), (x+1,y+1)\n   - Cannot move outside the grid boundaries\n6. Direction System:\n   - N:  treasure is somewhere in the region above your current position\n   - NE: treasure is somewhere in the upper-right region\n   - E:  treasure is somewhere in the region to your right\n   - SE: treasure is somewhere in the lower-right region\n   - S:  treasure is somewhere in the region below your current position\n   - SW: treasure is somewhere in the lower-left region\n   - W:  treasure is somewhere in the region to your left\n   - NW: treasure is somewhere in the upper-left region\n   The direction indicates a general area, not a specific cell\n7. MAGNETIC INTERFERENCE:\n   - When you get a direction, there's 50% chance it's completely wrong\n   - However, wrong directions never appear in consecutive moves\n   - If you get a wrong direction, the next move's direction is guaranteed correct\n\nMove Types:\n1. To move to a position:\n   Format: 'My Choice: X Y'\n   where X,Y are grid coordinates (1-based)\n   Example: 'My Choice: 2 3' moves to row 2, column 3\n\n2. To collect treasure:\n   Format: 'My Choice: COLLECT'\n   - Only use when you're sure you're on the highest value treasure\n   - You only get one collection attempt\n\nAfter each move:\n- If you find a treasure: 'TREASURE v' (v is the treasure's value)\n- If empty cell: 'EMPTY dir' (dir indicates which region contains nearest treasure)\n- If invalid move: 'INVALID_MOVE'\n\nExample interaction:\nYou: 'My Choice: 2 2'  \nMe: 'EMPTY SW' (indicates treasure might be in lower-left region, but could be wrong)\nYou: 'My Choice: 1 2'\nMe: 'EMPTY NE' (guaranteed correct: treasure is in upper-right region)\nYou: 'My Choice: 2 3'\nMe: 'TREASURE 80'\nYou: 'My Choice: COLLECT'\nMe: 'Win'\n\nKey Points:\n- Directions point to regions, not specific cells\n- If a direction seems wrong, the next one will be correct\n- Must find and be at highest value treasure to win\n- Wrong COLLECT attempt = game over\n\nReady to start?
