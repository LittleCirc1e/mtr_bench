{"question_id": 1, "prompt": "Let's play Cactus Search Game! Your task is to find a secret vertex in a cactus graph through strategic guessing.\n\nRules:\n1. The game is played on a cactus graph with 10 vertices (numbered from 1 to 10)\n2. A secret vertex v has been chosen\n3. After each incorrect guess, you'll be told which adjacent vertex leads closer to v\n\nGame Setup:\nThis cactus graph consists of 10 vertices and 4 distinct paths:\n   Path 1: a path of length 10 through vertices 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 10 -> 1\n   Path 2: a direct edge between vertices 5 and 7\n   Path 3: a direct edge between vertices 4 and 6\n   Path 4: a direct edge between vertices 2 and 4\n\nEach path represents a sequence of connected vertices, where consecutive vertices are connected by edges.\nThe graph is structured as a cactus, meaning each edge belongs to at most one cycle.\n\nQuery Format:\n1. To make a guess:\n   Format: 'My Guess: x'\n   where x is the vertex number (1 =< x =< 10)\n   Example: 'My Guess: 3'\n\n2. System Response:\n   - If correct: 'FOUND'\n   - If incorrect: 'GO w' (w is adjacent vertex closer to target)\n\nExample Interaction:\nYou: 'My Guess: 3'\nSystem: 'GO 4'\nYou: 'My Guess: 4'\nSystem: 'FOUND'\n\nInstructions:\n1. Make guesses based on previous responses\n2. Use exactly the format shown above\n3. Explain your reasoning before each guess\n\nRemember:\n- Each vertex is numbered from 1 to 10\n- The graph structure is fixed as described above\n- Adjacent vertices in paths are directly connected\n- Use responses wisely to navigate towards target\n\nReady to start?
