To make a guess:\n   Format: 'My Guess: x'\n   where x is the vertex number (1 =< x =< 12)\n   Example: 'My Guess: 3'\n\n2. System Response:\n   - If correct: 'FOUND'\n   - If incorrect: 'GO w' (w is adjacent vertex closer to target)\n\nExample Interaction:\nYou: 'My Guess: 3'\nSystem: 'GO 4'\nYou: 'My Guess: 4'\nSystem: 'FOUND'\n\nInstructions:\n1. Make guesses based on previous responses\n2. Use exactly the format shown above\n3. Explain your reasoning before each guess\n\nRemember:\n- Each vertex is numbered from 1 to 12\n- The graph structure is fixed as described above\n- Adjacent vertices in paths are directly connected\n- Use responses wisely to navigate towards target\n\nReady to start?
