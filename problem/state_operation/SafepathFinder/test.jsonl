{"question_id": 1, "prompt": "Let's play SafepathFinder! Your task is to find a safe path from start to the goal while avoiding hidden traps.\n\nRules:\n1. You are an explorer on a 5*5 grid\n2. Start: (1,1), Goal: (5,5)\n3. Each cell can be either:\n   - SAFE: can move through\n   - TRAP: ends game if stepped on (hidden)\n4. At each cell, you can:\n   - See the number of traps in adjacent cells (DANGER_LEVEL)\n   - Cannot see traps until stepped on them\n5. Movement rules:\n   - From position (x,y), you can move to any adjacent cell:\n   - (x-1,y-1), (x-1,y), (x-1,y+1)\n   - (x,y-1),             (x,y+1)\n   - (x+1,y-1), (x+1,y), (x+1,y+1)\n   - Cannot move outside grid\n   - Example: from (2,2) you can move to any surrounding cell\n\nMove Format:\n'My Choice: X Y'\nwhere X,Y are coordinates (1-based)\nExample: 'My Choice: 2 3'\n\nAfter each move you will see:\nDANGER_LEVEL v \n- v is the number of traps in the 8 adjacent cells\n- Higher number means more danger nearby\n- 0 means no traps in adjacent cells\n\nExample interaction:\nYou: 'My Choice: 2 1'\nMe: 'DANGER_LEVEL 1'\nYou: 'My Choice: 3 2'\nMe: 'DANGER_LEVEL 2'\n\nGame Ends When:\n- SUCCESS: Reach (5,5)\n- FAILURE: Step on a trap\n- INVALID: Try to move outside grid or not to adjacent cell\n\nStrategy Tips:\n- Higher DANGER_LEVEL means more risk\n- Watch how DANGER_LEVEL changes as you move\n- Use these changes to deduce trap locations\n- Sometimes longer path might be safer\n- Pay attention to diagonal movements too\n\nReady to start?
