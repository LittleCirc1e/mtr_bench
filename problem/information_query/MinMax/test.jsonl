{"question_id": 1, "prompt": "Let's play Find Min Max! Your task is to find the minimum and maximum elements in a hidden array.\n\nRules:\n1. You are given an array of length 5, but you cannot see its elements\n2. You can only compare two elements by their positions (i and j)\n3. After each comparison, you'll receive one of these responses:\n - '<': element at position i is less than element at position j\n - '=': element at position i equals element at position j\n - '>': element at position i is greater than element at position j\n\nExample:\nIf we have an array of length 3:\n- Query \"1 2\" would get:\n '>' (means element at position 1 is greater than element at position 2)\n- Query \"2 3\" would get:\n '<' (means element at position 2 is less than element at position 3)\n\nQuery Types:\n1. Ask about comparison:\n - Format: \"My Query: i j\" (i and j are positions to compare)\n - Response will be '<', '=' or '>'\n\n2. Submit final answer:\n - Format: \"My Answer: i j\" (where i is minimum position, j is maximum position)\n - Response will be:\n * 1 if correct\n * 0 if incorrect\n\nInstructions:\n1. You must explain your reasoning before each query\n2. Format your responses exactly as shown above\n3. You can only compare two different positions at a time\n\nRemember:\n- Positions must be between 1 and 5\n- Choose comparisons wisely to minimize queries\n\nReady to start? Make your first query!", "answer": "52877", "min_pos": 2, "max_pos": 3, "type": "Information Query", "feedback": "Indirect Value Response", "scale": 5, "difficulty": "easy", "title": "MinMax"}
