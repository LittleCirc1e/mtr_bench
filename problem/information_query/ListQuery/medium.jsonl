Make queries to explore the linked list\n2. Use exactly the formats shown above\n3. Explain your reasoning before each query/answer\n\nRemember:\n- Following next pointers, values are in increasing order\n- You need to find minimum value of the list\n- Position indices start from 1\n- Think carefully about which positions to query\n\nReady to start?
