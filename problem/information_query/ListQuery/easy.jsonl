To submit final answer:\n   Format: 'My Answer: ans'\n   where ans is either:\n   - The minimum value in the list\n   Example: 'My Answer: 80'\n\nExample Interaction:\nList length = 5, start = 3, x = 80\nYou: 'My Query: 1'\nMe: 'value=97, next=-1'\nYou: 'My Query: 3'\nMe: 'value=16, next=2'\nYou: 'My Answer: 80'\nMe: 'Correct'\n\nInstructions:\n1. Make queries to explore the linked list\n2. Use exactly the formats shown above\n3. Explain your reasoning before each query/answer\n\nRemember:\n- Following next pointers, values are in increasing order\n- You need to find minimum value of the list\n- Position indices start from 1\n- Think carefully about which positions to query\n\nReady to start?

{"question_id": 30, "prompt": "Let's play Linked List Query Game! Your task is to find a specific value in a sorted linked list through queries.\n\nRules:\n1. There is a hidden sorted linked list with 5 elements\n2. Each element has a value and a next pointer (pointing to the next element's index)\n3. You can make two types of queries:\n   - VALUE query: you will get both value and next pointer at position i\n   - ANSWER submission: you will get a feedback of 'Correct' or 'Incorrect'\n\nQuery Types:\n1.
