{"question_id": "1", "prompt": "Let's play Bitwise Query Game! Your task is to discover the hidden array through bitwise operations.\n\nRules:\n1. There is a hidden array of 6 integers\n2. Each element in the array is between 0 and 5 inclusive\n3. You can ask three types of queries about any two positions i and j:\n   - AND query: returns the bitwise AND of elements at positions i and j\n   - OR query: returns the bitwise OR of elements at positions i and j\n   - XOR query: returns the bitwise XOR of elements at positions i and j\n\nQuery Types:\n1. To make a query:\n   Format: 'My Query: OPERATION i j'\n   where:\n   - OPERATION is one of: AND, OR, XOR\n   - i and j are positions in array (1-based indexing)\n   Example: 'My Query: OR 1 2'\n\n2. To submit final answer:\n   Format: 'My Answer: a1 a2 ... a6'\n   where a1 to a6 are your guessed array elements\n   Example: 'My Answer: 0 0 2 3'\n\nExample Interaction:\nArray length = 6\nYou: 'My Query: OR 1 2'\nMe: '0' (result of OR operation)\nYou: 'My Query: OR 2 3'\nMe: '2' (result of OR operation)\nYou: 'My Query: XOR 2 4'\nMe: '3' (result of XOR operation)\nYou: 'My Answer: 0 0 2 3'\n\nInstructions:\n1. Make queries based on previous results\n2. Use exactly the formats shown above\n3. Explain your reasoning before each query\n4. Remember you have limited queries (7)\n\nRemember:\n- All array elements are between 0 and 5\n- Position indices start from 1\n- Think carefully about which operations to use\n- Use your queries wisely to gather maximum information\n\nReady to start?
