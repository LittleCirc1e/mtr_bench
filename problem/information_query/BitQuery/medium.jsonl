You can ask three types of queries about any two positions i and j:\n   - AND query: returns the bitwise AND of elements at positions i and j\n   - OR query: returns the bitwise OR of elements at positions i and j\n   - XOR query: returns the bitwise XOR of elements at positions i and j\n\nQuery Types:\n1. To make a query:\n   Format: 'My Query: OPERATION i j'\n   where:\n   - OPERATION is one of: AND, OR, XOR\n   - i and j are positions in array (1-based indexing)\n   Example: 'My Query: OR 1 2'\n\n2. To submit final answer:\n   Format: 'My Answer: a1 a2 ... a8'\n   where a1 to a8 are your guessed array elements\n   Example: 'My Answer: 0 0 2 3'\n\nExample Interaction:\nArray length = 8\nYou: 'My Query: OR 1 2'\nMe: '0' (result of OR operation)\nYou: 'My Query: OR 2 3'\nMe: '2' (result of OR operation)\nYou: 'My Query: XOR 2 4'\nMe: '3' (result of XOR operation)\nYou: 'My Answer: 0 0 2 3'\n\nInstructions:\n1. Make queries based on previous results\n2. Use exactly the formats shown above\n3. Explain your reasoning before each query\n\nRemember:\n- All array elements are between 0 and 7\n- Position indices start from 1\n- Think carefully about which operations to use\n- Use your queries wisely to gather maximum information\n\nReady to start?
