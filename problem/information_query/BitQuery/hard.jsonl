{"question_id": "30", "prompt": "Let's play Bitwise Query Game! Your task is to discover the hidden array through bitwise operations.\n\nRules:\n1. There is a hidden array of 12 integers\n2. Each element in the array is between 0 and 11 inclusive\n3. You can ask three types of queries about any two positions i and j:\n   - AND query: returns the bitwise AND of elements at positions i and j\n   - OR query: returns the bitwise OR of elements at positions i and j\n   - XOR query: returns the bitwise XOR of elements at positions i and j\n\nQuery Types:\n1.
