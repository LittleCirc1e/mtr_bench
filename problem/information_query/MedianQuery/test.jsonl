{"question_id": 1, "prompt": "Let's play Median Query Game! Your task is to find specific positions in a hidden permutation through median queries.\n\nRules:\n1. There is a hidden permutation p of length 6 (numbers 1 to 6)\n2. You can make queries about subsequences of even length\n3. Each query returns the two middle values (medians) of your chosen subsequence\n4. Your goal is to find positions of values 3 and 4\n\nQuery Types:\n1. To make a query:\n   Format: 'My Query: k x1 x2 ... xk'\n   where:\n   - k is the length of subsequence (even number, 4 \u2264 k \u2264 6)\n   - x1 to xk are distinct positions (1-based indexing)\n   Example: 'My Query: 6 1 2 3 4 5 6'\n   Response will be two numbers: the k/2-th and (k/2+1)-th smallest values in the subsequence\n\n2. To submit final answer:\n   Format: 'My Answer: i j'\n   where i and j are positions of values 3 and 4\n   Example: 'My Answer: 3 6'\n\nInstructions:\n1. Make queries based on previous results\n2. Use exactly the formats shown above\n3. Explain your reasoning before each query\n\nRemember:\n- The permutation contains numbers 1 to 6 exactly once\n- Position indices start from 1\n- Think carefully about which subsequences to query\n- Use your queries wisely to locate the target positions\n- Order of positions in final answer doesn't matter\n\nReady to start?
