{"prompt": "Let's play Guess The Maximums!\n\nRules:\n1. Hidden array A[1...50] contains numbers from 1 to 50\n2. You need to guess 7 numbers forming the password\n3. For password position i, you are given Si = subset of positions to exclude\n4. Password[i] = max value among all positions EXCEPT those in Si\n\nYour subsets are:\nS1=[10, 48], S2=[42, 50], S3=[7, 49], S4=[35, 36], S5=[28, 38], S6=[15, 37], S7=[3, 24, 33]\n\nPassword Example:\nFor n=4, k=2, if:\nS1 = {1,3}, S2 = {2,4}\nAnd hidden array A = [3,1,2,4]\nThen:\n- Password[1] ignores positions 1,3 (S1)\n  So looks at A[2]=1, A[4]=4\n  Password[1] = 4\n- Password[2] ignores positions 2,4 (S2)\n  So looks at A[1]=3, A[3]=2\n  Password[2] = 3\nTherefore, the answer is \"4 3\".\n\nInteraction format:\n1. Your Query: \n- Format: \"My Query: x1 x2 ... xm\"\n- xi = positions you want to query (1=<m<50) \n- You'll receive the maximum value at these positions\n\n2.
