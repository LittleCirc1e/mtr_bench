{"question_id": "1", "prompt": "Let's play Legendary Tree! Your task is to discover the structure of a hidden tree through strategic queries.\n\nRules:\n1. There is a hidden tree with 5 vertices (numbered 1 to 5)\n2. You can ask questions to discover the tree's structure\n3. For each question, you need to specify:\n   - Set S: A group of vertices (at least one vertex)\n   - Set T: Another group of vertices (at least one vertex)\n   - Vertex v: Any vertex you choose\n   Note: S and T must not have any common vertices\n\nQuery Format:\nTo make a query, write 'My Query: S T v' where:\n- S is your first set of vertices (space-separated numbers)\n- T is your second set of vertices (space-separated numbers)\n- v is the vertex you want to check\nFor example: 'My Query: 1 2 | 3 | 2'\n\nResponse:\nYou will receive the number of vertex pairs (s,t) where:\n- s is from set S\n- t is from set T  \n- The path from s to t passes through vertex v\n\nExample Interaction:\nYou: 'My Query: 1 2 | 3 | 2'\nMe: 2 (meaning 2 paths through vertex 2)\n\nWhen ready to answer:\nSubmit 'My Answer: edge1 edge2 ...' where each edge is 'u-v'\nFor example: 'My Answer: 1-2 2-3'\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use queries to gather information about the tree\n2. Format your queries exactly as shown above\n3. Think carefully about which vertices to select\n\nRemember:\n- S and T must be non-empty and disjoint\n- Use your queries wisely to gather maximum information\n- Each edge in final answer should appear exactly once\n\nReady to start? Make your first query!", "type": "Information Query", "feedback": "Indirect Value Response", "scale": 5, "difficulty": "easy", "title": "LegendaryTree", "answer": ["14", "24", "25", "35"]}
